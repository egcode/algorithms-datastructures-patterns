### [Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/) <br>

Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.



#### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

```
