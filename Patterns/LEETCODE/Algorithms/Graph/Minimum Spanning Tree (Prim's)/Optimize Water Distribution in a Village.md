### [Optimize Water Distribution in a Village](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village/) <br>

There are `n` houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house `i`, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost `wells[i - 1]` (note the `-1` due to **0-indexing**), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array `pipes`, where each <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=pipes[j]"> = [<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=house1_j">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=house2_j">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=cost_j">] represents the cost to connect <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=house1_j"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=house2_j"> together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Return the **minimum total cost to supply water to all houses**.


#### Example 1:
<img src="../../../../../images/1168_ex1.png">

```
Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1]]
Output: 2

```
